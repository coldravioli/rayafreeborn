          <h1 class="lato-thin">Hi!</h1>
          <p>
            My name is <b>Raya Freeborn</b>, and I am an multimedia artist from Blacksburg, Virginia. I am currently a junior pursuing a BFA in graphic design at Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts, as well as two minors in computer science and media studies. I am passionate about both tactile and digital design, creative advertising, web development, and product marketing.
            <br><br>
            As a graphic designer with a strong foundation in visual storytelling, hands-on production, and creative problem-solving, I bring an interdisciplinary skill set to tackle both design and digital challenges. I strive to craft multimedia-based experiences which move beyond their dimensions to engage, connect, and reel-in diverse audiences.

            <h2 class="lato-light">What is 'Life After Breakfast'?</h2>

<p>
            A bit before turning 14, I bought myself a camera bag at a local camera shop. Surrounded by decaying film camera bags sat a Los Microwaves'  record titled <b><i>'Is there life after breakfast?'</i></b> Intrigued by the playful absurdity, I found myself drawn to projects loosely connected to food.
            <br><br>
            My hyperfixation with breakfast foods began with my first pancake, but was catalyzed by a brief encounter with the 80s vinyl. Over time, <b><i>Life After Breakfast</i> (L.A.B.)</b> became a personal brandâ€” a playful exploration of meaning and creativity that continues to shape the way I create, cook, and express myself.
