            Hi!
<br><br>

            My name is Raya Freeborn, and I am an multimedia artist from Blacksburg, Virginia. I am currently pursuing a BFA in graphic design at Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts, as well as two minors in computer science and media studies. 
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, I'm a graphic design student passionate about creating engaging and meaningful experiences that connect with audiences. With a strong foundation in visual storytelling, hands-on production, and collaborative problem-solving, I bring a fresh and interdisciplinary approach to design challenges.

            <h2 class="lato-light">Why and what is ‘Life After Breakfast’?</h2>

<p>
            A bit before turning 14, I bought myself a camera bag at a local camera shop. Surrounded by decaying film camera bags sat a vintage record labeled ‘Los Microwaves’. The album posed the question- is there life after breakfast? Intrigued and in awe of random nothingness, I began to seek projects loosely intertwined with food. 
            <br><br>


            Ultimately, my hyperfixation with breakfast foods began with my first pancake, but was catalyzed by a brief encounter with the 80s vinyl.
