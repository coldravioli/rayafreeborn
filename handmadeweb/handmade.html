                <li>For this small workshop project, focus on experimenting with and articulating structure and space within a website. As this is a quick exercise, you'll probably want to focus more on the form of the site rather than worrying too much about function â€” but, try to consider how the form might communicate/enhance/embody an intended function. Experiment with css positioning and flexbox (or explore css grid and tables) to construct your site.
