            A website can be a plethora of things. Whether it's an online shop, wiki site, or even a Spotify music generator, all are considered websites. There is no limit to what a website can be, making it a living, growing organism.

In that moment, I've never once before yearned for a subway surfers edit below the screen. My patience was stretched incredibly thin. Attention can be exchanged, and can be used like a currency.
